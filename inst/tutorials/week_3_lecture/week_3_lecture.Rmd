## Week 3 Lecture

### Species Distribution Modelling

Russell Dinnage

## What are SDMs

* Sometimes called Environmental Niche Models (ENMs, I prefer SDM)
* Possible the most well-developed application of classic Data Science and Machine Learning (ML) in Biology
* They take in data on the environment at different sites or parts of a landscape and try predict where (or when, or how many) organisms will occur there. Data on the species themselves can also be used
* Traditionally done on single species at a time, but 'joint' species distribution models are increasingly common

## SDMs as Data Science

- To make an SDM you use a Data Science workflow
- The final model used to predict species occurrence is fit using Machine Learning techniques
- A Data Science workflow has two major components: 
  - Data
  - a Model
 
## Data and Models

* Data Processing Steps
* Model Building

* Data feeds into Models
* Models inform Data processing steps

## Data Science Steps

1. **A Question**
2. **Collect Data**
3. **Munge / Clean Data**
4. Transform Data for Model
5. Analyze Data using Model
6. Tune Model
7. Validate / Test Model
8. Interpret Model

- We have covered some of this already
- We will cover the rest in the next 4 weeks

## What is a Model?

- Encodes a relationship between a set of inputs and outputs
- For an SDM this is a (potentially complex and nonlinear) function that takes environmental variables as input and  its output is an occurrence pattern (could be abundance, probability, suitability, etc.)
- Different Models differ in their assumptions, or 'inductive biases', and their parameters
- Models are 'fit' to data
  - Parameters are chosen based on how well the Model's output matches the real data
  - This is an optimization problem

## The Simplest Model?

### The Linear Model

- Models outputs as a 'linear' function of inputs
- Inputs are 'predictor' variables
- Outputs are predictions, and they are compared to 'response' variable(s)
- Assumes responses are a additive linear function of predictors

## Fit a Linear Model to Reef Fish Data
### Setup

```{r do_setup, exercise=TRUE}
library(sdmpack)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
```

```{r do_setup-check}
ls()
```

## Fit a Linear Model to Reef Fish Data

- Base R has a good collection of statistical methods including the linear model.
- `RF_abund` has data on the abundance of different reef species at different reefs around the world

```{r map, echo=FALSE}
data("RF_sites")
RF_sites <- sf::st_as_sf(RF_sites, coords = c("SiteLong", "SiteLat"),
                         crs = 4326)
mapView(RF_sites)
```

```{r RF1, exercise=TRUE}
data("RF_abund")
RF_abund
```

```{r RF1-check}
ls()
```

## Fit a Linear Model to Reef Fish Data

- First let's choose a fish species to model
- Thalassoma pavo: [Ornate Wrasse](https://www.fishbase.se/summary/Thalassoma-pavo.html)

```{r, out.width = "300px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://rdinnager.github.io/sdmpack/images/week_5_lecture_insertimage_2.png")
```

```{r RF2, exercise=TRUE}
fish_dat <- RF_abund %>%
  filter(SpeciesName == "Thalassoma pavo")
```

```{r RF2-check}
ls()
```

## Fit a Linear Model to Reef Fish Data

- `lm()` is the basic linear model function in R.
- Let's do a linear model on our fish species with temperature as a predictor

```{r RF3, exercise=TRUE}
mod <- lm(
  AbundanceAdult40 ~ MeanTemp_CoralWatch, 
  data = fish_dat)
```

```{r RF3-check}
ls()
```

## R 'formulas'

```{r form, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
mod <- lm(
  ### <b>
  AbundanceAdult40 ~ MeanTemp_CoralWatch, 
  ### </b>
  data = fish_dat)
```

- A formula is a special data structure in R
- It is specified using an expression of this form: `lhs ~ rhs`, where `lhs` stands for Left Hand Side, and `rhs` stands for Right Hand Side. 
- Formulas compactly express a relationship between variables: `lhs` contains 'response' variables that we wish to model as a function of the variables on the `rhs`: the 'predictor' variable
- Both `lhs` and `rhs` can contain multiple variables and function calls (we will see examples of that later on)
- Though a formula can be missing `lhs`, they must always have a `~` and a `rhs` (`~ rhs` is a valid formula)

---

```{r RF4, exercise=TRUE}
summary(mod)
```

```{r RF4-check}
ls()
```

## Fit a Linear Model to Reef Fish Data

```{r RF5, exercise=TRUE, fig.height=3}
ggplot(fish_dat, aes(x = MeanTemp_CoralWatch, y = AbundanceAdult40)) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE, color = "red") + geom_point() + theme_minimal()
```

It is much easier to tell if the model is useful at all by visualizing.


```{r RF5-check}
ls()
```

## Fit a Linear Model to Reef Fish Data

- This model is not a good fit, and there might be some other problems
  - Models have assumptions
  - Does our data fit the assumptions?
- I won't go through all linear model assumption, but one is that the distribution of the data is not too extreme (skewed, or with long tails)

## Fit a Linear Model to Reef Fish Data

Distribution of Abundance:

```{r abund_dist, echo=TRUE}
 hist(fish_dat$AbundanceAdult40, breaks = 100)
```

## Fit a Linear Model to Reef Fish Data

- One way to 'fix' the data is to transform it, for example:

```{r abund_dist2,echo=TRUE}
 hist(log(fish_dat$AbundanceAdult40), breaks = 50)
```

---

However the main problem seems to stem from the fact that a line is not a good description on the response. Therefore, most SDM methods that are actually used allow for non-linear relationships. In this case (and many cases), some kind of hump shaped function might make sense.

```{r plotit}
p <- ggplot(fish_dat, aes(x = MeanTemp_CoralWatch, y = AbundanceAdult40)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "red") + geom_point() + theme_minimal()
suppressMessages(print(p))
```

## `tidymodels`

- `tidymodels` is an R package for statistical and machine learning models
- It shares the philosophy of programming and data analysis with `tidyverse`
- It has functions that mirror the step of Data Science that I presented earlier
- Like `tidyverse` it is a meta-package, bundling several other packages together

## `parsnip`: a `tidymodels` package to fit models

- `parsnip` separates the model 'structure' from the implementation
- It unifies inputs and outputs, so that it is simple to switch between different modelling methods without writing new code

## Fit a Linear Model with `parsnip`

```{r parsnip1, exercise=TRUE}
mod_pars <- linear_reg(engine = "lm")
mod_pars
```

```{r parsnip1-check}
ls()
```

## Fit a Linear Model with `parsnip`

- A model is fit using the `fit()` function
- `parsnip` is designed work with pipe operators (`%>%` or `|>`) 

```{r parsnip2, exercise=TRUE}
mod_pars <- linear_reg(engine = "lm") %>%
  fit(AbundanceAdult40 ~ MeanTemp_CoralWatch,
      data = fish_dat)
mod_pars
```

```{r parsnip2-check}
ls()
```

## Fit a Linear Model with `parsnip`

- Parameters are extracted with the `tidy()` function.

```{r parsnip3, exercise=TRUE}
mod_summ <- tidy(mod_pars)
mod_summ
```

```{r parsnip3-check}
ls()
```

## Fit a Linear Model with `parsnip`

- Visualize the fit by prediction

```{r parsnip4, exercise=TRUE}
preds <- predict(mod_pars, new_data = fish_dat)
preds
pred_dat <- fish_dat %>%
  bind_cols(preds)
```

```{r parsnip4-check}
ls()
```

---

```{r parsnip5, exercise=TRUE}
p <- ggplot(pred_dat, aes(x = MeanTemp_CoralWatch, y = .pred)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point(aes(y = AbundanceAdult40)) + 
  theme_minimal()
suppressMessages(print(p))
```

```{r parsnip5-check}
ls()
```

---

```{r parsnip6, exercise=TRUE}
p <- ggplot(pred_dat, aes(x = MeanTemp_CoralWatch, y = .pred)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point(aes(y = AbundanceAdult40)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log1p") + theme_minimal()
suppressMessages(print(p))
```

```{r parsnip6-check}
ls()
```

## The power of `parsnip`

- Now that the model is specified in `parsnip`, it is easy to change our model to one that can model nonlinear relationships easily. Let's try doing a gradient boosted decision tree (you don't need to know what that is for now).

```{r randforest1, exercise=TRUE}
mod_pars2 <- boost_tree(mode = "regression") %>%
  fit(AbundanceAdult40 ~ MeanTemp_CoralWatch,
      data = fish_dat)
mod_pars2
```

```{r randforest1-check}
ls()
```

## The power of `parsnip`

```{r randforest2, exercise=TRUE}
preds2 <- predict(mod_pars2, new_data = fish_dat)
pred_dat2 <- fish_dat %>%
  bind_cols(preds2) 
```

```{r randforest2-check}
ls()
```

## The power of `parsnip`

```{r randforest3, exercise=TRUE}
p <- ggplot(pred_dat2, aes(x = MeanTemp_CoralWatch, y = .pred)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point(aes(y = AbundanceAdult40)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log1p") + theme_minimal()
suppressMessages(print(p))
```

```{r randforest3-check}
ls()
```

## Overfitting

An important concept in Data Science and Machine Learning is the idea of overfitting. The above model appears to 'overfit' the data -- its predictions jump around wildly to try and fit each individual data point. But this in not likely to generalize well if applied to a new dataset. We reduce overfitting by tuning the 'hyper-parameters' of the algorithm to make it produce 'smoother' predictions. Smoothed prediction are more likely to generalize better to new datasets. This is accomplished using a method called cross-validation, which we will cover in depth in Week 7.

- Next week will be: Reading Assignment 
  - Read another section of Intro to Statistical Learning and a scientific paper on SDMs (I'll assign both)
  - Answer a multiple choice quiz about the readings
  - I will also provide another Tutorial to help you prepare for Week 5
  - It will not be marked, but would be good practice to complete

- Week 5 we will cover:
  - How to go from abundance data to presence / absence (e.g. occurrences)
  - How to include data preprocessing and model fitting in one workflow using `tidymodels`
  - A little bit of ecological niche theory to understand what SDMs represent and why they are important
